:::{#hero-heading}

Hello and welcome!

I am currently an Assistant Professor of Statistics at Cal Poly in San Luis Obispo, CA. 

My research interests are driven by a desire to do research with applications in education and public health. Within these broad fields, I am interested in educational interventions, pedagogy, equity in education, social determinants of health, and equity in health care access.

I am also committed to improving as an instructor and am interested in Statistics pedagogy, with particular interest in improving instruction of introductory statistics courses.
